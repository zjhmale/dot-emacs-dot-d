;; Overview:
;;
;; Fiplr makes it really use to find files anywhere within your entire project
;; by using a cached directory tree and delegating to ido while you search the
;; tree.
;;
;;   M-x fiplr-find-file
;;
;; By default it looks through all the parent directories of the file you're
;; editing until it finds a .git, .hg, .bzr or .svn directory. You can
;; customize this list of root markers by setting `fiplr-root-markers'.
;;
;;   (setq fiplr-root-markers '(".git" ".svn"))
;;
;; Some files are ignored from the directory tree because they are not text
;; files, or simply to speed up the search. The default list can be
;; customized by setting `fiplr-ignored-globs'.
;;
;;   (setq fiplr-ignored-globs '((directories (".git" ".svn"))
;;                               (files ("*.jpg" "*.png" "*.zip" "*~"))))
;;
;; These globs are used by the UNIX `find' command's -name flag.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   Find files:        M-x fiplr-find-file
;;   Find directories:  M-x fiplr-find-directory
;;   Clear caches:      M-x fiplr-clear-cache
;;
;; For convenience, bind "C-x f" to `fiplr-find-file':
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x f") 'fiplr-find-file)
