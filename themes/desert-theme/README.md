desert-theme
==================

The original version using color-theme can be found
[here](https://github.com/superbobry/color-theme-desert).

A port of a well-known VIM [theme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=105). Feel free
to add any extra faces, since the theme is definitely not complete :)
